<h1> Traffic lights on the E21 field</h1>  
  
There are 2 traffic lights on the field and they can burn with such colors:
+ **Red** color
+ **Yellow** color
+ **Green** color
  
<h2>Red:</h2>  

If a **red** light is on at a traffic light, robot should stop in front of it or in front of a black line. And continue movement when a **green** light is on at a traffic light:

<h2>Yellow:</h2>  

If a **yellow** light is on at a traffic light, robot should stop in front of it or in front of a black line. And continue movement when a **green** light is on at a traffic light.  
**But** if robot already crossed the line when the yellow light came on, it can complete movement:
