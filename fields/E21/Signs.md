<h1> Signs on the E21 field</h1>  
  
There are 4 signs on the field and they may be:
+ **Turn Left** sign
+ **Turn Right** sign
+ **Move Forward** sign
+ **Stop** sign
  
<h2>Turn Left:</h2>  

For example, if You have **Turn Left** sign at the start (green rect) You should move like that:  
![Turn Left Example 1](https://github.com/CrackAndDie/robocadSim/blob/master/res/left_example_1.png?raw=true "Turn Left Example 1")  
or like that:
![Turn Left Example 2](https://github.com/CrackAndDie/robocadSim/blob/master/res/left_example_2.png?raw=true "Turn Left Example 2")  
and check next sign (red rect) if You need it.  

<h2>Turn Right:</h2>  

For example, if You have **Turn Right** sign at the Distant village (green rect) You should move like that:  
![Turn Right Example 1](https://github.com/CrackAndDie/robocadSim/blob/master/res/right_example_1.png?raw=true "Turn Right Example 1")  
or like that:
![Turn Right Example 2](https://github.com/CrackAndDie/robocadSim/blob/master/res/right_example_2.png?raw=true "Turn Right Example 2")  
and check next sign (red rect) if You need it.

<h2>Move Forward:</h2>  

For example, if You have **Move Forward** sign at the start (green rect) You should move like that:  
![Move Forward Example 1](https://github.com/CrackAndDie/robocadSim/blob/master/res/forward_example_1.png?raw=true "Move Forward Example 1")  
and check next sign (red rect) if You need it.  

<h2>Stop:</h2>  

For example, if You have **Stop** sign at the start (green rect) You should stop in front of the sign and wait for 2 seconds. After that You can continue Your movement wherever You want. Example:  
![Move Forward Example 1](https://github.com/CrackAndDie/robocadSim/blob/master/res/stop_example_1.png?raw=true "Move Forward Example 1")  

<h2>All signs:</h2>  

Here is an example of movement when robot has to go to the Pine village and take containers from there:  
![All signs Example 1](https://github.com/CrackAndDie/robocadSim/blob/master/res/all_signs_example_1.png?raw=true "All signs Example 1")  
![All signs Example 2](https://github.com/CrackAndDie/robocadSim/blob/master/res/all_signs_example_2.png?raw=true "All signs Example 2")
